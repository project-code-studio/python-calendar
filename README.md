# Calendar

A simple Calendar Project using Python

## Pre-Requisites

Basic knowledge is recommended for the below courses.
- **datatime module**
    - Useful for date and time manipulation rather than just using strings
    - More docs here:-
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
- **dataframes**
    - Useful when you need to manage/manipulate big data in your in-memory object
    - Provides useful functions for data management:- sorting/filtering etc.
    - More docs here:-
        - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html
- **dictionaries and other python data structures**
    - Different data structure can be used in different scenarios to speed up/improve the efficiency of our program/codebase.
    - Getting an idea about how these can be used and how effective they are will help in writing more efficient codebase.
    - More docs here:-
        - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
- **functions**
    - Writing custom functions by replacing repetitive code blocks can improve in code readability.
    - This would help in better code management for other developers as well.
    - More docs here:-
        - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
        - https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/
- **i/o module**
    - Python supports input/output from command line.
    - This can be useful when we need user intervention in our program.
    - More docs here:-
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print
- **csv module**
    - Python supports reading data from CSVs.
    - This helps in using static CSVs in our program to improve the code structure.\
    - More docs here:-
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
- **json module**
    - Python supports reading data from JSONs.
    - This helps in using static JSONs in our program to improve the code structure.
    - JSON is a more standardized way of data management which stays intact/common between cross-platforms.
    - More docs here:-
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
